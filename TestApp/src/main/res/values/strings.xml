        culture for more than seven years by competing in world class robotics competitions while
        working together with our sponsors, school, community, and volunteers. By working with FIRST,
        the premiere robotics competition of its kind, KING TeC provides nearly unlimited technological
        opportunities to grow young minds within our community into the technology leaders of tomorrow.
