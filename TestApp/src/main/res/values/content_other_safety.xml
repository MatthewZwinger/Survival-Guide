        <item>Your team should be safe in all of their endeavors. It is the role of the safety coordinator/captain/lead (whatever title your team decides upon) to make sure your team is safe at all times. Here is a list of things that a safety captain should oversee and maintain:&lt;br>&lt;br>
First Aid Kit: Your team should have a first aid kit with everything you may need in case of an accident. You should keep a log of inventory, and document when supplies are used, so you can get more when needed. If any products included in the kit expire, make sure they are still good before going to competition.&lt;br>&lt;br>
Injury Log: Have a log documenting when injuries occur. This can also give you an idea of what people get hurt doing. If these types of injuries repeat, you may want to adjust rules to stop these injuries from happening.&lt;br>&lt;br>
Team Safety Manual: It is the role of the safety captain to create, maintain, or update your team’s safety rules. Your team should have a safety manual. Inspectors and judges will be impressed if you have a thorough set of rules your team has established. &lt;br>&lt;br>
Emergency Contacts: Have a list of numbers people can contact in case of an emergency. These can be general, such as Poison Control’s number. More specifically, a student on the team could have a certain condition that requires a specific contact.</item>
