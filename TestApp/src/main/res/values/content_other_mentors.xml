        <item>Why Off-Season Tournaments</item>
        <item>The main reason for off season regionals are to train rookie team members and get back
            into the swing of robotics. Before the real regionals begin, it is very useful to give
            the new team members a taste of what to expect. These mini competitions also give teams
            a great opportunity to train members whether it is in driving, scouting or spirit.
            These competitions are hosted by FRC teams and are one day events normally held in
            gymnasiums of the hosting team. Around thirty teams can be found at these regionals.
            Official FIRST fields are shipped to the location and official FIRST judges, refs, and
            tech managers are running the event. These regionals provide a nice opportunity for
            FIRST volunteers to get trained into leadership positions. Awards are given out and
            winners are crowned all in good fun.</item>
