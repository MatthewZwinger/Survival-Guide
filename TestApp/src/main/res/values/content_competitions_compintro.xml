        <item>Introduction to the Competition</item>
        <item>This is it. Six weeks (and possibly more) have prepared you and your robot, and it all comes down to the Competition.
            However, in order to arrive to the tournament feeling more ready than ever, there are a few things you may have to prepare
            for first. Now depending on which competition system your region follows (Regional or District Events), some rules for the
            rankings and qualifying spots are different, but for the most part, ideas stay the same no matter what system your region runs.
            This guide will give you everything you need to know for those, provided you also give the game manual for that year an in-depth
            read. Generally speaking, competitions can be divided into three “main parts,” that are very distinct from one another:\n\n
            Preparation\n\nQualifying Matches\n\nElimination Matches\n\nDuring your 2-3 day competition, each of these stages are equally
            important to your team’s success, and it is critical that you know what to expect going in. Each of these parts have a
            special section devoted to them, with sub-sections highlighting the differences between Regional and District events
            to give an in-depth explanation of everything a team needs to know. Finally, an explanation of competition structure
            and the different levels of competition procession all the way to the World Championships is provided.
